/*

Package units represents valid units of measure (the Unit type) and families
of related units (the Family type).

The Unit type can be used to convert between a value expressed in the base
unit and some other chosen unit. The Unit values show how many of the base
unit are in the alternative unit. To convert a value held in the base units
into a value expressed in the alternative units you should call the
ConvertFromBaseUnits func.
